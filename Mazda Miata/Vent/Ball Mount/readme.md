# 1990-2005 Mazda Miata 16.83mm Ball Mount Vent Replacement
- Vent replacement that allows you to use a magnetic phone holder (or anything else that can use the very specific sized 16.83mm ball mount) in your mazda miata.
- Very roughly stylized to match the oem vents.

### How do I use it?
I made this for a phone holder, if you'd like to do the same you can 3D print it, buy [this](https://a.co/d/hwKEtoO), take the ball mount off and pop the magnetic piece onto the vent replacement.

In the future I will probably make another variant that uses a more standard ball size but for now it's a one off project for my car.
